## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Git installed on your computer (download from https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Using GitHub

### Apple
1. Open Terminal on your Apple device.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the GitHub repository using the `cd` command. For example, `cd Documents` to navigate to the "Documents" directory.
3. Clone the repository by running the following command in Terminal:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone.
4. You now have a local copy of the repository on your Apple device.

### Windows
1. Open Command Prompt or Git Bash on your Windows device.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the GitHub repository using the `cd` command. For example, `cd Documents` to navigate to the "Documents" directory.
3. Clone the repository by running the following command in Command Prompt or Git Bash:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone.
4. You now have a local copy of the repository on your Windows device.

## Syncing a Git Repository to Read the Docs
1. Sign in to Read the Docs at https://readthedocs.org using your GitHub account.
2. Click on the "Import a Project" button.
3. Select the GitHub repository you want to sync from the list.
4. Choose the appropriate settings for your project, such as version control type and documentation type.
